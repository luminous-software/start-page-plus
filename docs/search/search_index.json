launch Visual Studio as Administrator, you can't get back to a non-elevated session by\nclicking on \nRestart Visual Studio\n.\nThere doesn't seem to be a programmatic way to force an elevated session

Overview page.\nOn there you can see what the latest available version of \nStart Page+\n is at the top of the page.\n\n\nOptions\n\u00b6\n\n\nClicking on the \nOptions\n link is a quick way to get to the \nStart Page+\n options page without\nhaving to use \nTools\n | \nOptions\n | \nStart Page+\n.\n\n\nDeveloper News\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe \nDeveloper News\n feed brings back VS 2017's handy list of Microsoft developer-related news items that was removed from\nVS 2019.\nI don't know how many times I've seen something that interests me that I might have missed if I hadn't seen it on my\nstart page.\n\n\n\n\nItems Feed Url\n\u00b6\n\n\nBy default the feed url is set to the url of the original \nDeveloper News\n that used to be in Visual Studio 2017.\nMicrosoft is currently still maintaining that feed, but could stop doing so at any time.\nYou could choose to use the \nVisual Studio Blog\n feed url instead if you wanted.\n\n\nIn the past the two feeds have displayed a different set of posts,\nwith Visual Studio Blog having more posts that the Developer News feed.\nBut it seems that may currently have the same items.\n\n\nThe \nVisual Studio Blog\n feed url is \nhttps://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/feed\n.\n\n\nItems to Display\n\u00b6\n\n\nYou can choose the number of items that are displayed in the list.\n\n\nThere are only 10 items in the orginal feed, and Microsoft replaces older posts with new ones.\nIf you set a feed url to something that has a lerger number of items you might want to limit\nhow many are downloaded and displayed.\n\n\nOpen Items in VS\n\u00b6\n\n\nBy default the items open right in VS itself, rather than switching to the default browser.\nPersonally, I prefer having to switch applications as little as possible.\nWhen I'm working in Visual Studio, I prefer to stay in Visual Studio, and not have my attention derailed by having\nto switch to a different application, and then back again to Visual Studio.\n\n\nHowever, for those people who prefer links to be opened in their default browser,\nthere's an option to change \nStart Page+\n's behavior to do just that.\n\n\nLinks\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nRefresh\n\u00b6\n\n\nThere is currently no auto-refresh for \nDeveloper News\n, so you'll have to click \nRefresh\n to\ncheck if you have the latest available news items from Microsoft.\n\n\nAlso, when you select the number of items to display, you'll need to click the \nRefresh\n link\nto see the change.\n\n\nSettings\n\u00b6\n\n\nClicking on the \nSettings\n link will open the \nTools\n | \nOptions\n | \nStart Page+\n | \nDeveloper News\n\nsettings page without having to navigate through the dropdowns.\n\n\nGeneral Options\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nEnable Start Page+\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis setting allows \nStart Page+\n to be disabled if you need to,\nwithout having to uninstall the \nStart Page+\n extension, which would require you to exit\n\nall\n instances of Visual Studio, wait while the \nVSIX installer\n does its thing,\nthen open Visual Studio again.\n\n\nEnable Start Page+ Options\n\u00b6\n\n\nBy default, a 'Start Page+ Options' command is added to the \nTools\n | \nOptions\n menu.\nThis setting lets you choose to not have the menu item added.\n\n\nThe default value is \ntrue\n.\n\n\nMax Width\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis setting will allow you to make the contents of the \nStart Page+\n window wider or narrower\n\n\nThe default value is \n1175\n.\n\n\nVersion Number\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis setting simply displays the version number of \nStart Page+\n that's currently installed.\n\n\nStart Tab Options\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShow Start Tab Title\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis setting determines whether the \nStart\n tab title is displayed.\n\n\nThe default value is \ntrue\n.\n\n\nStart Tab Title Text\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis setting will allow you to change the text of the \nStart\n tab title.\n\n\nThe default value is \nWhat would you like to do today?\n.\n\n\nRecent Items

File Extensions\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis setting allows to hide a project/solution's extension (.csproj, .sln) in the \nRecent Items\n list.\n\n\nThe default value is \nfalse\n;\n\n\nDeveloper News Options\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nClear List Before Refresh\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis setting clears the list before the data is retrieved, so there's a visual cue that the\nlist has in fact been refreshed.\n\n\nThe default value is \ntrue\n.\n\n\nItems to Display\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis setting will allow you to determine how many items are displayed in the \nDeveloper News\n list.\n\n\nThe default value is \n10\n.\n\n\nItems Feed Url\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis setting allows you to change the feed url for \nDeveloper News\n to any RSS feed that you choose.\n\n\nThe default value is \nhttps://vsstartpage.blob.core.windows.net/news/vs\n.\n\n\nOpen Links in VS\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen this setting is set to \ntrue\n, any clicked item that opens a web page will be opened in a browser window\n\ninside\n of Visual Studio.\n\n\nWhen set to \nfalse\n, clicked items will be opened in your default browser.\n\n\nThe default value is \ntrue\n.",
